# Deep Learning Framework for Multi Layer Perceptron

## What we are asked to do

Build a simplistic Deep Learning Framework for **Multi-Layer-Perceptron** activated with **Relu** or with **tanh**. In a way, it is a Multi-Layer Perceptron Framework. Our framework is as efficient as PyTorch, both in time performances and in classification performances. 

## Files 

Inside the src/ directory is all our code: 

- **framework/**: contains all the files of the MLP Framework.
    - module.py
    - linear.py
    - relu.py
    - tanh.py
    - sequential.py
    - loss.py
    - __init__.py (to make it a python package)
- **test.py**: required executable for the given classification task
- **utils.py**: contains function used to generate the dataset. 
- **test_performance.py**: a script to run several models and make plots.  

(*additionally we also provide the following*)
- **test_MNIST.py**: example of how to use the framework with MNIST dataset.
- **dlc_practical_prologue.py**: script to load the MNIST, provided in the course material.
